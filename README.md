# Purpose
This homework utilizes node.js to take in command line arguments and log a desired result. 

# Instructions
Users can input four different commands:

* my-tweets

* spotify-this-song

* movie-this

* do-what-it-says

my-tweets will return the 20 most recent tweets as well as a time-stamp of each one.
